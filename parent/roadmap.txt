[Audit]

Given Process type annotation

like @Audit - record all standard auditing

on process start
AUDITPOINT

DISPOSED_TASK					taskId|disposeFuncName
ENDED_TASK						taskId|disposeFuncName
CHANGED_CRITCAL_VALUE			taskId|disposeFuncName|oldValaue|newValue	

[Points win Prizes]

Weight processes, tasks and dispose actions with points 

[Start process]
Add drop down to select role context to start in - is intersection of process roles and user roles 

[Claim task]
Add drop down to select role context to start in 

[Add to Task API]
startProcess(String name, Map<String, String> args, IUser String initiatorRole]) start latest version of name
task groups (if task A depends on task B then start the B of the same task group)

ITask.waitForGroup(groupname)

[Security & Permisions]
Add support for SSO 

[Messaging]
(have to wait for TOMEE+ 1.6 or run separate TOMEE+ 1.5.2 and have this push messages)
Upload listener JAR, add it to the message listener class loader URL list
This is a filter chain member: 

class ProcessXListener

ProcessXListener(Context) {

	void accept(Message) {
	
		//examine message
		
		Context.consume();
		
		or
		
		Context.startProcess(name, Map args, consume=true|false)
		
		or 
		
		Context.passToProcess(instance_id, message_handler_name)
		
		
	
	
	}

}



which either consumes or ignores a message
